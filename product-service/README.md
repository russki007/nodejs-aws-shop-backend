# Backend services for React Shop
This repository hosts the backend API services for [React Shop](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/nodejs-aws-shop-react). It also includes an infrastructure as code (IaC) project using AWS CDK and TypeScript.   high-level architecture diagram for the overall solution can be viewed [here](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/aws/blob/main/aws-developer/Architecture.pdf).


## Bootstrapping
If you haven't used CDK or haven't deployed anything using CDK, you need to [bootstrap your account/region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/bootstrapping.html). To do that, run the following command:

`cdk bootstrap aws://{ACCOUNT-NUMBER}/{REGION}`
